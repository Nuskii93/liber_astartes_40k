          <description>A unit composed entirely of models with Jump Packs may set its Movement Characteristic to a value of 12 for the duration of the controlling player&apos;s turn. This allows the unit to move up to 12&quot;, regardless of the Movement Characteristic shown on its profile, and gain any other benefits of a Movement Characteristic of 12 (including the bonus to Charge Distance, see page 181). In addition, if the controlling player chooses to set the unit&apos;s Movement to 12&quot;, the unit ignores terrain while Moving and Charging, and may move over friendly and enemy models/units. A unit that ends of begins its Movement or a Charge in Dangerous Terrain will still need to take Dangerous Terrain tests as normal, even when employing Jump Packs, and threats all Difficult Terrain as Dangerous Terrain.
Any model equipped with a Jump Pack also gains the Bulky (2) and Deep Strike special rules, or if it already has the Bulky (2) special rule it gains the Bulky (3) special rule instead. A unit equipped with Jump Packs may not Run.
During Reactions made in any Phase, a unit equipped with Jump Packs may not activate them to gain any bonuses to their Movement Characteristics.</description>

          <description>Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain Vehicles, Dreadnoughts, Automata or any model with the Monstrous sub-type (unless the Independent Character also has that Unit Type or sub-type). They can join other Independent Characters though to form a powerful multicharacter unit.

Joining and Leaving a Unit
An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent which unit it has joined.

In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that they are within unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within unit coherency of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to, or cannot, join a unit, it must, where possible, remain outside of unit coherency with that unit at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can Move no further that Movement phase.
An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. They cannot join or leave during any other Phase – once shots are fired or Charges are declared.

An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either they or the unit are in Reserve, locked in combat, Falling Back or have been Pinned. They cannot join a unit that is in Reserve, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, they again become a unit of one model at the start of the following Phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, they count as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though they still follow the rules for Characters.

Special Rules
When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.

Independent Characters and Infiltrate
An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.

Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects
Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the Independent Character leaves the unit, both the Independent Character and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the Independent Character accordingly.

Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after they themselves have been the target of an ongoing effect), benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.</description>

• Enemy models cannot be deployed using the Infiltrate special rule within 18&quot; of a model with an augury scanner.
• A unit that includes at least one model with an augury scanner ignores the 24&quot; limit to line of sight when making Shooting Attacks while the Night Fighting rules are in effect.
• When any enemy unit is deployed to the battlefield from Reserves, a unit that includes at least one model with an augury scanner may make the Interceptor Advanced Reaction (see the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook, page 309) without expending a point of the Reactive player’s Reaction Allotment. This does not allow the unit to make more than one Reaction per Phase, but does allow the controlling player to exceed the normal three Reactions limit in a given Phase.</characteristic>

            <characteristic name="Description" typeId="250d-e1a0-86ec-0ae2">Boarding shields confer a 5+ Invulnerable Save, but a model with a boarding shield cannot claim bonus attacks for having more than one melee weapon, or make attacks during the Assault phase using a weapon with the Two-handed special rule. Boarding Shields give a model the Heavy subtype.
Invulnerable saves granted by a combat shield or boarding shield do not stack with other Invulnerable Saves, but can benefit from rules (like cyber-familiar) that specifically increase existing saves. If a model has another Invulnerable Save then the controlling player must choose which one to use.</characteristic>

In addition, in lieu of the model with the cognis-signum making a Shooting Attack in the Shooting phase, all other models in the same unit gain a bonus of +1 to their BS for that Shooting phase. This benefit is not cumulative, and no unit can benefit from more than one bonus to their BS from cognis-signum.</characteristic>

Once triggered, the model with smoke launchers counts as being more than 25% obscured, regardless of terrain, until the start of the controlling player’s next turn and gains a 6+ Cover Save. A model whose smoke launchers have been triggered may not make any Shooting Attacks, except as part of a Reaction, in the same turn. Smoke launchers may only be used once per battle, and once triggered may not be further used – in addition, they do not count as a weapon and may not be targeted by Weapon Destroyed results on the Vehicle Damage table.</characteristic>

          <characteristics>
            <characteristic name="Description" typeId="250d-e1a0-86ec-0ae2">At the start of the controlling player’s Movement phase, a model with a Warhawk jump pack may set its Move Characteristic to a value of 12 for the duration of the controlling player’s turn (sometimes referred to as ‘activating’ the jump pack). This allows a model with a Warhawk jump pack to move up to 12&quot;, regardless of the Movement Characteristic shown on its profile and gain any other benefits of a Movement Characteristic of 12 (including the bonus to Charge distance). In addition, all models with a Warhawk jump pack that have been activated ignore terrain while Moving and Charging, but must take Dangerous Terrain tests as normal when beginning or ending their Movement in Dangerous Terrain. A model with an activated Legion Warhawk jump pack treats all Difficult Terrain as Dangerous Terrain and may move over both friendly and enemy models or units without penalty – but must end its Movement at least 1&quot; away from any model from another unit.


A model with a Warhawk jump pack may still Run if it would normally be able to Run (this does not allow units that include any models with the Heavy Sub-type to Run). When making a Run move for a model with an activated Warhawk jump pack, add the Initiative Characteristic of that model to 12 to determine how far it may move – the model ignores terrain and models from other units while making a Run move with a  Warhawk jump pack as previously noted, but may not make Shooting Attacks or declare a Charge in the same turn in which it has Run as per the normal rules for Running.


Any model with a Warhawk jump pack also gains the Bulky (2), Hammer of Wrath (1) and Deep Strike special rules – if it already has the Bulky (2) special rule, it gains the Bulky (3) special rule instead.


During a Reaction made in any Phase, a player may not choose to activate a model’s Warhawk jump pack to gain any bonus to its Movement Characteristic.</characteristic>

            <characteristic name="Description" typeId="250d-e1a0-86ec-0ae2">All of the controlling player&apos;s units with the Chapter Tactics (X) special rule within 6&quot; of a friendly model with a Chapter standard are considered to have a Leadership Characteristic of 10 when resolving Morale checks or Pinning tests 
(but not Psychic checks). 
In addition, all models in a unit that includes a Chapter standard gain the Line Sub-type as long as they remain part of that unit. Also the unit containing a Chapter Standard gains +1 to combat resolution. If any reason a combat is drawn, the unit with the Chapter Standard instead wins the combat by 1. If both units have a Chapter Standard, there is no bonus. These benefits are lost immediately if the model with the Chapter Standard is removed as a casualty, in addition the enemy gains D3 Victory Points.</characteristic>

            <characteristic name="Description" typeId="250d-e1a0-86ec-0ae2">The controlling player of a model with a helical targeting array may activate it at the start of any of their own turns, or, if the controlling player is not taking the first turn of the battle, at the start of the battle, before the beginning of the opposing player&apos;s first turn. Once the helical targeting array is activated, this model is affected by the following conditions until the beginning of the controlling player’s next turn:
• The model may not move, Run or declare or make any Reactions other than the Interceptor or Overwatch Reaction.
• The controlling player may choose to use the Skyfire special rule when making any Shooting Attacks with the model.
• No model may make a Damage Mitigation roll provided by the Shrouded special rule against an attack made by a model with a helical targeting array while it is active.
• When the model makes a Shooting Attack as part of the Interceptor Reaction, the Reaction does not cost the controlling player a point from their Reaction Allotment. This does not allow the unit to make more than one Reaction per phase, but does allow the controlling player to exceed the normal three Reactions limit in a given phase.
• When a model with the Vehicle Unit Type and a helical targeting array makes a Shooting Attack as part of the Interceptor Reaction, that model may fire all of its weapons, not just Defensive Weapons, as part of the Shooting Attack.</characteristic>

• Disruption Mode: Any Reserves rolls made by an enemy player to bring units into play from Reserve are modified by -r while this mode is active. This modifier does not stack with any otlher negative modifiers to Reserves rolls - use the highest single modifier instead. However, once the final negative modifier to a Reserves roll is determined, it can b,e reduced by any positive modifiers applied to the roll (for example if a Reserves roll was affected by both a -r and + r modifier then they would cancel each other and no modifier would be applied).
• Relay Mode: Any Reserves: rolls made by the controlling player to bring units into play from Reserves may be re­rolled while this mode is active.</characteristic>

    <rule id="6b8e-d57d-101c-71dd" name="Area Denial Drop" publicationId="0a24-8d5a-55ca-b028" page="116" hidden="false">
      <description>Before the start of the first turn, when placing units into Reserve, a player must assign all Legion Deathstorm Drop Pods in the army to Reserve to perform an Area Denial Drop. At the beginning of the controlling player’s first turn, before any other models are moved or deployed, all of the Area Denial Drop units must enter play using the procedure described below:

Performing an Area Denial Drop
When deploying the Area Denial Drop, the controlling player selects one of the available units to deploy first. Place a single model from that unit anywhere on the battlefield that is at least 6&quot; from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain and is outside of all Deployment Zones. Do not scatter the model.

If possible, the model must be placed in a position that will allow any other models in the same unit to deploy (as follows), and may only be placed in a position that denies the remainder of the squad a place within unit coherency if no other position is available.

Once the model’s final position has been decided, the remainder of the unit may be deployed anywhere that is within unit coherency and more than 6&quot; from any enemy model or piece of Impassable Terrain. Any models that cannot be placed are removed as casualties.

Once this first unit has been deployed, roll a D6. On the roll of a ‘1’, the Area Denial Drop is Disordered and the opposing player may deploy each remaining unit in the Area Denial Drop anywhere within 12&quot; of the first unit without scattering, though no model may be within 1&quot; of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. If the roll is a ‘2’ or higher, the controlling player deploys each remaining unit anywhere within 12&quot; of the first, though no model may be within 1&quot; of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain.

Once all units are deployed, any enemy units within line of sight and range may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction (see page 309 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook) targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop. Any units that are chosen to make the Interceptor Reaction do not expend any of the controlling player’s Reaction Allotment for the Phase, but do count as having made a Reaction (and thus cannot React again in this Phase). Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of an Area Denial Drop.

Once all units from the Area Denial Drop have been deployed and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have been deployed as part of an Area Denial Drop may not Move or Run in the same Movement phase as they are deployed, but may Shoot and declare Charges as normal (if the models deployed as part of the Area Denial Drop are allowed to make Charges).</description>

      <description>If a model or weapon has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armour penetration when targeting a Vehicle model, or, when targeting a model with the Automata or Dreadnought Unit Type, re-rolls all failed rolls To Wound instead. These effects apply to both Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

Some instances of the Armourbane special rule may include a qualifier after the rule in brackets, for example Armourbane (Melta) or Armourbane (Melee). These variant rules are described below:

Armourbane (Melta): A model or weapon with this Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when at half range or less. If the attack is more than half its Maximum Range away, it rolls to penetrate as normal. If a weapon with this version of Armourbane also has the Blast special rule (see page 234), measure the distance to the centre of the Blast marker after it has scattered. If this is half the weapon’s range or less, then all Hits are counted as having the Armourbane special rule, otherwise the Hits are resolved as if they did not have the Armourbane special rule.

Armourbane (Melee): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when attacking in close combat.

Armourbane (Ranged): A weapon or model with this version of the Armourbane special rule only gains the benefits of the Armourbane special rule when making Shooting Attacks.</description>

      <description>All Barrage weapons use Blast markers and consequently use the rules for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions:
Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their Minimum Range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6&quot;. If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its Minimum Range.
Note that any Hits inflicted upon Vehicles by an Attack using the Barrage special rule are always resolved against the Vehicle’s Side Armour Value.

Multiple Barrages
If a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:
The Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier. Once the first marker is placed, roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below). If a Hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker). Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of Hits and roll To Wound for these Hits. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first Blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.

Apocalyptic Barrage
An Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped Apocalyptic Barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it. 

Once the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the Apocalyptic Barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire Apocalyptic Barrage marker.</description>

Models in the targeted unit must still be in range in order for these additional Hits to take effect. These additional Hits do not themselves inflict more Hits and do not benefit from any other special rules possessed by the attacking model, such as Preferred Enemy (X) or Precision Strikes (X).</description>

      <description>Before the start of the first turn, when placing units into Reserve, a player using the Drop Pod Assault Rite of War must assign all Legion Drop Pods, Legion Dreadnought Drop Pods, Legion Dreadclaw Drop Pods or Legion Kharybdis Assault Claws as well as the units Embarked upon them to perform a Drop Pod Assault.

All units assigned to a Drop Pod Assault must enter play at the start of the controlling player’s first turn, before any other units are moved and following the Drop Pod Assault procedure as follows:

Performing a Drop Pod Assault
To deploy those models assigned to a Drop Pod Assault onto the battlefield, first the controlling player must select any one Legion Drop Pod, Legion Dreadnought Drop Pod, Legion Dreadclaw Drop Pod or Legion Kharybdis Assault Claw assigned to the assault. Place that model anywhere on the battlefield that is at least 1&quot; from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain and then scatter that model (see the Scatter rules on page 152 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook).

If the model’s final position is within 1&quot; of an enemy model, any battlefield edge or a piece of Impassable Terrain then the controlling player’s opponent may move that model to any position within 18&quot; that is more than 1&quot; from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain. If there is no suitable position within 18&quot; then the model may be repositioned anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 1&quot; from any enemy model, battlefield edge or piece of Impassable Terrain. If possible, the model must be placed in a position that will allow the models Embarked within to deploy (see as follows), and may only be placed in a position that denies the Embarked unit space to deploy if no other position is available.

Once this first unit has been deployed, roll a dice. On the roll of a ‘1’ the Drop Pod Assault is Disordered, and the opposing player may deploy each remaining Legion Drop Pod, Legion Dreadnought Drop Pod and Legion Dreadclaw Drop Pod and Legion Kharybdis Assault Claw in the Drop Pod Assault anywhere within 24&quot; of the first unit without scattering, though no model may be within 1&quot; of an enemy model or within Impassable terrain. If the roll is a ‘2’ or higher, the controlling player deploys those models anywhere within 24&quot; of the first, though no model may be within 1&quot; of an enemy model or within Impassable Terrain. If possible, each model must be placed in a position that will allow the models Embarked within to deploy (see as follows), and may only be placed in a position that denies the Embarked unit space to deploy if no other position is available. Once all of the Legion Drop Pods, Legion Dreadnought Drop Pods and Legion Dreadclaw Drop Pods and Legion Kharybdis Assault Claw have been placed, any enemy units that have one or more models within 6&quot; of any model deployed as part of the Drop Pod Assault must make an immediate Pinning test. Once all Pinning tests are resolved, all units Embarked on a Legion Drop Pod, Legion Dreadnought Drop Pod or Legion Dreadclaw Drop Pod and Legion Kharybdis Assault Claw deployed as part of this Drop Pod Assault, must Disembark following the normal rules for Disembarking. Any models that cannot be Disembarked are removed as casualties.

Once all units taking part in the Drop Pod Assault have Disembarked, any enemy units that are neither Pinned or Falling Back and are within line of sight may choose to make the Interceptor Reaction (See page 309 of the Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness rulebook) targeting any one of the units deployed as part of the Drop Pod Assault or that has Disembarked from a model deployed as part of the Drop Pod Assault. Note that no Reaction other than Interceptor may be made against the deployment of a unit as part of a Drop Pod Assault.

Once all units from the Drop Pod Assault have been deployed and any Interceptor Reactions have been resolved, the turn proceeds as normal. Units that have been deployed as part of a Drop Pod Assault may not Move or Run in the same turn as they are deployed, but may make Shooting Attacks as normal in the Shooting phase. During the Assault phase, only units deployed from a model with the Transport Sub-type with the Assault Vehicle special rule may declare and resolve a Charge and Assault as normal, other units deployed as part of a Drop Pod Assault may not declare or resolve a Charge on the same turn as they are deployed.</description>

A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 To Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Weapons that do not Roll To Hit 
Weapons that do not roll To Hit (such as Blast weapons) must roll a D6 for each shot immediately before firing. On a 2+, the shot is resolved as normal. For each roll of a 1, the weapon Gets Hot; that shot is not fired and the firing model immediately suffers a single Wound with an AP value equal to that of the weapon that was used to attack (Armour Saves, Invulnerable Saves and Feel No Pain rolls can be taken, but not Cover Saves or Shrouded rolls) – this Wound cannot be allocated to any other model in the unit. A Vehicle instead rolls a D6 for each roll of a 1 to Hit. If this roll results in a 1 or 2, the Vehicle suffers a Glancing Hit.

Gets Hot and Re-rolls
If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit (including because of BS 6+ or the Twin-linked special rule), a Wound is only suffered if the To Hit re-roll is a 1; it may also re-roll Gets Hot results of 1 for weapons that do not roll To Hit.</description>

      <description>A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule that is locked in combat can choose to leave close combat at the end of any Assault phase. If the unit wishes to do so, it must take an Initiative test.
If the Test is failed, nothing happens and the models remain locked in the fight.
If the Test is passed, choose a direction – then roll 2D6 and add the unit’s Movement Characteristic to the result. As long as the distance rolled, in inches, is sufficient to allow the entire unit to move over 1&quot; away from all of the enemy units they are locked in combat with, the unit breaks away from combat and must immediately move a number of inches in the chosen direction equal to the 2D6 + Movement result, ignoring the models they were locked in combat with. No Sweeping Advance rolls are made. Enemy units that are no longer locked in combat immediately Consolidate a number of inches equal to their Initiative.
A Hit &amp; Run Move is not slowed by Difficult Terrain, but does trigger Dangerous Terrain tests as normal. It may not be used to move into base or hull contact with enemy units, and models instead stop 1&quot; away. If there are units with this rule on both sides who wish to disengage, roll off to determine who goes first and then alternate disengaging them.

      <description>You may choose to deploy units that contain at least one model with this special rule last, after all other units (friend and foe) have been deployed. If both players have such units and choose to do so, the players roll off and the winner decides who goes first, then alternate deploying these units.

Units that Infiltrate in this way can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9&quot; from any enemy unit, as long as no deployed enemy unit can draw line of sight to them. This includes in a Building (see page 224), as long as the Building is more than 9&quot; from any enemy unit.

If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport, the same rules apply when deploying their Transport.
A unit that deploys using these rules cannot Charge in their first turn.
Having Infiltrate also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Infiltrators that are kept as Reserves (see page 309).

      <description>If a non-Vehicle unit suffers one or more unsaved Wounds from a weapon with the Pinning special rule, it must take a Leadership test once the firing unit has finished its Shooting Attacks for that Phase. This is called a Pinning test. If the unit fails the Test, it is Pinned. As long as the Test is passed, a unit can be called upon to take multiple Pinning tests in a single turn, but only once for each unit shooting at them.

A unit that is affected by any of the following conditions does not take Pinning tests, and if called upon to do so is considered to automatically pass them:
• The unit is locked in combat.
• The unit is already Pinned (the unit remains Pinned, but takes no further Tests).
• The unit is composed entirely of Vehicle models.
• The unit is Embarked on a Transport Vehicle.
• The target unit is affected by the Fearless special rule.

A unit that has become Pinned cannot Move, Run or Charge. It can only fire Snap Shots if it attacks during the Shooting phase and cannot make Reactions in any Phase. At the end of its following turn, the unit returns to normal and the unit is free to act as normal from then on. Whilst it is Pinned, a unit is affected normally by enemy actions (for example, it takes Morale checks as normal). If the unit is forced to move, for example if it has to Fall Back, it returns to normal immediately. If assaulted, the unit will fight as usual, but because they are not set to receive the Charge, enemy units do not receive the Initiative penalty for assaulting a unit in Difficult Terrain (see page 222), even if the unit is in Difficult Terrain. If a unit becomes Pinned during a Charge, then that Charge automatically fails. Units that are locked in combat cannot be Pinned and do not take Pinning tests.</description>

A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule re-rolls failed To Hit and To Wound rolls of 1 if attacking its Preferred Enemy. This applies both to Shooting Attacks and close combat attacks.

If a model with this rule makes an attack against a mixed unit which has one or more models to which their Preferred Enemy rule pertains, but is not entirely composed of such models, it may still benefit from the effects of Preferred Enemy for all attacks made against that unit. For example, a model with Preferred Enemy (Independent Characters) may re-roll failed To Hit and To Wound rolls of 1 against all of the models in a unit which has been joined by an Independent Character.</description>

      <description>If a model has the Rending special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has the Rending special rule, there is a chance that their close combat attacks will strike a critical blow. For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon’s normal AP value.
Similarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.
In either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weapon’s AP value.
For example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon.</description>

If the unit is Infantry, Artillery, Dreadnought or Automata, each model can redeploy anywhere entirely within 6&quot; of its current position. If it is any other Unit Type, each model can instead redeploy anywhere entirely within 12&quot; of its current position. During this redeployment, Scouts can move outside the owning player’s Deployment Zone, but must remain more than 9&quot; away from any enemy unit. A unit that makes a Scout redeployment cannot Charge in the first Game Turn. A unit cannot Embark or Disembark as part of a Scout redeployment.

If both sides have Scouts, roll off; the winner decides who redeploys first. Then alternate redeploying Scout units one at a time. If a unit with this special rule is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, it confers the Scout special rule to the Transport (though a Disembarkation cannot be performed as part of the redeployment). Note that a Transport with this special rule does not lose it if a unit without this special rule is Embarked upon it. Having Scout also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Scouts that are kept as Reserves (see page 309).

      <description>When a model with this special rule suffers an unsaved Wound, Glancing Hit or Penetrating Hit, it can make a special Shrouded roll to ignore it (this is not a Saving Throw and so can be used against attacks that state that &apos;no Saves of any kind are allowed&apos;). Shrouded rolls may not be taken against Melee Attacks, against attacks with the Ignores Cover special rule or for models with the Fearless special rule.
Roll a D6 each time an unsaved Wound, Glancing Hit or Penetrating Hit is suffered by a model with this special rule. On a result that is equal to or greater than the value in brackets, that unsaved Wound, Glancing Hit or Penetrating Hit is ignored. On any other result, the Wound, Glancing Hit or Penetrating Hit is applied as normal. For example, a unit with the special rule Shrouded (6+) would need to score a 6 in order to ignore a Wound, Glancing Hit or Penetrating Hit inflicted upon it.
If on any unit this rule is presented simply as Shrouded, without a value in brackets, then count it as Shrouded (6+)

      <description>Unlike most other Vehicles, Skimmers have flying bases under their hull. However, distances are still measured to and from the Skimmer’s hull, with the exception of the Vehicle’s weapons, which all work as normal. The base of a Skimmer is effectively ignored, except for when the Skimmer is being Charged or Rammed, in which case, models may move into contact with the Vehicle’s hull, its base or both.

Skimmers can move over friendly and enemy models, but they cannot end their move on top of either. Skimmers can move over all terrain, ignoring all penalties for Difficult Terrain and Dangerous Terrain tests. However, if a moving Skimmer starts or ends its move in Difficult Terrain or Dangerous Terrain, it must take a Dangerous Terrain test. A Skimmer can even end its move over Impassable Terrain if it is possible to actually place the model on top of it, but if it does so it must take a Dangerous Terrain test. If a Skimmer is forced to end its move over friendly or enemy models, move the Skimmer the minimum distance so that no models are left underneath it.

If a Skimmer is Immobilised or Wrecked, its base is removed, if possible. If this is not possible (the base might have been glued in place, for example), then leave the base in place. Note that it is not otherwise permitted to remove the flying base, as Skimmers cannot land in battle conditions.</description>

      <description>Template weapons are indicated by having the word ‘Template’ for their range instead of a number. Instead of rolling To Hit, simply place the template so that its narrow end is touching the base of the firing model, or the end of the firing weapon’s barrel for Vehicle models without bases, and the rest of the template covers as many models in the target unit as possible, without touching any other friendly models (including other models from the firing model’s unit). Any models fully or partially under the template are hit. Against Vehicles, the template must be placed to cover as much of the Vehicle as possible without touching a friendly model. The position of the firer is used to determine which armour Facing is hit (see page 207). A Template weapon never hits the model firing it.

Template weapons have the Ignores Cover and Wall of Death special rules. Wounds inflicted by Template weapons are allocated following the normal rules.

Multiple Templates
If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Template type, resolve each shot, one at a time, as described above, determining and recording how many Hits are scored by each template. Once the number of Hits from all templates has been determined, roll To Wound as normal.

Wall of Death
Template weapons can fire Snap Shots at any non-Flyer target. If a Template weapon fires as a Snap Shot, it automatically inflicts D3 Hits on the target unit, resolved at its normal Strength and AP value, as long as the target unit either has at least one model within 8&quot; or if the target unit is resolving a Charge against the unit making the Shooting Attack. If the weapon is also a Hellstorm weapon then it instead inflicts D6 Hits.

Hellstorm Weapons
Hellstorm weapons have the word ‘Hellstorm’ instead of a range on their weapon profile. Hellstorm weapons use the Hellstorm template (see page 152), but otherwise obey the rules for other Template weapons.</description>

      <description>A model with this special rule has a number of void shields, as listed on its profile. Shooting Attacks which Hit a model with this special rule instead target this model’s void shields while at least one remains active. Void shields have an Armour Value of 12. A successful Glancing Hit, Penetrating Hit or any successful Hit from a Destroyer weapon which targets a void shield causes it to collapse, reducing the number ‘X’ by -1. When the number of void shields is reduced to 0, this special rule has no further effect and subsequent Shooting Attacks target the model instead. Void shields have no effect on close combat attacks, and may not be affected by close combat attacks.</description>
